Ever need to test if an inference endpoint is working or want to one-shot a model on a server? 

Maybe you want to cycle through keys or models or benchmark a bank of IPs. Perhaps you want to orchestrate `N` queries across `M` models running on `P` servers and want to run the job in parallel without leaving any leaky state behind.

Existing tools require you to pick from a provider boutique and a small list of models shipped with the software then swap around credentials like you're Indiana Jones with a bag of sand.



**llcat** is a solution to these problems: a general-purpose CLI-based OpenAI-compatible `/chat/completions` caller. It also works with Ollama, OpenRouter, sglang, vllm, llama.cpp and more. 

It has a rich syntax and supports a sophisticated set of features while keeping simple things easy. 

**llcat** is flexible. Look at how it can do agentic coding in just a single command.

Think of `llcat` like cURL or cat for LLMs: a stateless, transparent, explicit, low-level, composable tool for scripting and glue.

Conversations, which are regular JSON files, keys, servers and other configurations are explicitly specified each execution as command line arguments. There's a `--curlify` option as well. 

This makes building things with llcat direct.

For instance, let's say I have a list of authentication tokens in some file, `credentials.txt`:

```shell
sk-or-v1-e1e5...
sk-or-v1-ej24...
sk-or-v1-ff24...
```
Here's how you do that with llcat:

Method 1:
```shell
llcat -k @credentials.txt:0
llcat -k @credentials.txt:1
llcat -k @credentials.txt:2
```
Method 2:
```shell
llcat -k sk-or-v1-e1e5...
llcat -k sk-or-v1-ej24...
llcat -k sk-or-v1-ff24...
```

You can do the same pattern with models, system prompts, queries, and servers. For instance:

```shell
llcat --save invocation.json \
      -k "@~/credentials.txt:12" \
      -u "@settings.json:.[3].host" \
      -s "@system_prompts:8" \
      -m "@settings.json:.[3].model" \
         "@query.txt:12" > output.txt
```

**Wait wait wait, is that jq?**

Yes! You can use normal strings (ex: `"abc"`), files (ex: `@abc.txt`) with line numbers (ex: `@abc.txt:1`) and even `jq` syntax (ex: `@abc.json:.server[0].url`). This makes parallel distributed execution painless.

Here's a JSON pattern you might particularly like:

```shell
llcat -k @~/secrets.json:.openrouter
```

Also note that opening parameter `--save invocation.json`. If you open `invocation.json` you would see:

```json
{
  "server_url": "@settings.json:.[3].host",
  "server_key": "@~/credentials.txt:12",
  "model": "@settings.json:.[3].model",
  "system": "@system_prompts:8",
  "user_prompt": [
    "@query.txt:12"
  ]
}
```

So to re-invoke this set of parameters you can just do

```shell
llcat @invocation.json { ... parameters you want to override ... }
```

There's that `@` again, this time providing completely portable invocations as JSON.

### Simple Examples

List the models on [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai):

`uvx llcat openrouter.ai/api -m`

What about just the qwen ones?

`uvx llcat openrouter.ai/api -m '*qwen3*'`

What about their capabilities in JSON?

`uvx llcat openrouter.ai/api -m '*qwen3*' --info | jq .`

Sure. What about a different protocol, say ollama?

`uvx llcat localhost:11434 -m '*qwen3*' --info | jq .`

All the abstraction without those pesky leaks.

There's also support for schemas, dry-runs, expressing the calls as raw curls, adding body parameters (such as top_p or temperature), custom timeouts, and customizing thinking or streaming. 

The basic CLI parameters are compatible with [Simon Willison's llm](https://github.com/simonw/llm) which makes the transition a drop-in replacement. It's also faster than llm. Time it yourself. You'll see...

There's even an included tool for sanely manipulating the JSONs of the conversations for context engineering.

**llcat** is part of the [DAY50](https://day50.dev) suite of open-source tools built for a future where AI workloads are split across devices, private servers, and cloud APIs prioritizing predictability, compatibility, coherency, transparency and functionality.

## Examples

Here's some examples of how to use **llcat** as a building block for many common use-cases:

 * [Transferrable Conversations](#example-transferrable-conversations)
 * [Stateful Interaction](#example-adding-state)
 * [Interactive Chat](#example-interactive-chat)
 * [Structured Output](#example-structured-output)
 * [Evals](#example-evals)
 * [Tool Calling](#example-tool-calling)
 * [Agentic Coding](#example-agentic-coding)

## Example: Transferrable Conversations

Because conversations, models and servers are decoupled, you can mix and match them at any time.

Here's one conversation, hopping across models and servers.

Start a chat with Deepseek:
```
$ llcat -u https://openrouter.ai/api \
        -m deepseek/deepseek-r1-0528:free \
        -c /tmp/convo.txt \
        -k "$(cat openrouter.key)" \
        "What is the capital of France?"
```

Continue it with Qwen using [MAS format](https://day50.dev/mas.html) and using the `@` syntax for including the key by file:
```
$ llcat -u "https://openrouter.ai/api#m=qwen/qwen3-4b:free"
        -c /tmp/convo.txt \
        -k @openrouter.key \
        "And what about Canada?"
```

And finish on the local network. As a convenience, we're going to skip the `-u` and drop the schema. `llcat` is smart enough to figure it out.
```
$ llcat 192.168.1.21:8080 \
        -c /tmp/convo.txt \
        "And what about Japan?"
```

Since the conversation goes to the filesystem as JSON you can use things like `inotify` or `fuse` and push it off to a vector search backend or modify the context window between calls.
 
## Example: Adding State

**llcat's** explicit syntax means lots of things are within reach.

For instance wrappers can be made custom to your workflow. 

Here's a way [to store state](https://github.com/day50-dev/llcat/blob/main/examples/state.sh) with environment variables to make invocation more convenient:

```shell
llf()        { llc "$@" 2> >(jq . >&2) | examples/spinner sd }
llc()        { llcat -m "$LLC_MODEL" -u "$LLC_SERVER" -k "$LLC_KEY" "$@" }
llc-model()  { LLC_MODEL=$(llcat -m  -u "$LLC_SERVER" -k "$LLC_KEY" | fzf) }
llc-server() { LLC_SERVER=$1 }
llc-key()    { LLC_KEY=$1 }
```

And now you can do things like this:
```shell
$ llc-server http://192.168.1.21:8080
$ llc "write a diss track where the knapsack problem hates on the towers of hanoi"
```

And what's that `llf` at the top? That uses `jq` to pretty print the errors and `streamdown` to pretty print the output along with a program to display a spinner while you wait.

There's no configuration files to parse or implicit states to manage.

## Example: Interactive Chat

A conversation interface is [also quick](https://github.com/day50-dev/llcat/blob/main/examples/conversation.sh):

```shell
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# We pick a file for the conversation or allow a user to pass it in with a CONV environment variable
conv=${CONV:-$(mktemp)}
echo -e "  Using: $conv\n"

# Show the previous conversation if there is any, stylize it with streamdown
jq -r '.[] | "\n**\(.role)**: \(.content)"' $conv | sd

# Read prompts in a loop
while read -E -p "  >> " query; do

    # Take the command line arguments of the shell script, pass them to llcat
    llcat -c $conv "$@" "$query" |& sd
    echo
done
```
So now instead of

`llcat -u http://myserver -k mykey -m model`

Our conversation loop can be invoked like

`conversation.sh -u http://myserver -k mykey -m model`

Adding additional features is trivial.

## Example: Structured Output

Using the schema feature you can pass json in to enforce a schema. Try something like

```shell
$ llcat -u http://localhost:11434 -sc @examples/schema.json "give me a person"
```


## Example: Evals

Running the same thing on multiple models and assessing the outcome is straight forward. Here we're using [ollama](https://ollama.com)

```shell
pre="llcat -u http://localhost:11434"
for model in $($pre -m); do
   $pre -m $model "translate 国際化がサポートされています。to english" > ${model}.outcome
done
```

You can use patterns like that also for testing tool calling completion. [Here's a bigger example: a humor eval to see if models know a funny joke when they see one](https://github.com/kristopolous/humor-evals)

If an error happens contacting the server, you get the request, response, and a non-zero exit.

Try this to see what that looks like

`uvx llcat -u fakecomputer`

## Example: Tool calling
The examples directory contains this [music playing tool](https://github.com/day50-dev/llcat/blob/main/examples/tool_program.py) listing the contents of [this album](https://elektrobopacek.bandcamp.com/album/untitled): 

```shell
$ llcat -l json -u http://127.1:8080 -tf tool_file.json -tp tool_program.py "what mp3s do i have in my ~/mp3 directory"
{"level": "debug", "class": "toolcall", "message": "request", "obj": {"id": "iwCGjcRic8GAFB2jUvBUOeF9NNrldfxz", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "list_mp3s", "arguments": {"path":"~/mp3"}}}}
{"level": "debug", "class": "toolcall", "message": "result", "obj": ["Elektrobopacek - Towards the final Battle.mp3", "Elektrobopacek - Escape the Labyrinth.mp3", "Elektrobopacek - Journey to the misty Lands.mp3", "Elektrobopacek - Mistral Forte.mp3", "Elektrobopacek - Leaving Spaceport X-19.mp3", "Elektrobopacek - Dracula Rising.mp3"]}
Here are the MP3 files in your `~/mp3` directory:

1. **Elektrobopacek - Towards the final Battle.mp3**
2. **Elektrobopacek - Escape the Labyrinth.mp3**
3. **Elektrobopacek - Journey to the misty Lands.mp3**
4. **Elektrobopacek - Mistral Forte.mp3**
5. **Elektrobopacek - Leaving Spaceport X-19.mp3**
6. **Elektrobopacek - Dracula Rising.mp3**

Would you like to play any of these? Just share the filename, and I can play it for you! 🎵
```

In this example you can see how nothing is hidden so if the model makes a mistake it is immediately identifiable. 

The debug objects are either JSON objects (with -l json) which are sent to `stderr` so routing it separately is trivial or markdown objects (by default and with -l md) so you can stream them through whatever markdown renderer you are using

## Example: Agentic Coding
Using the examples above we can conbine them and get an agentic harness on the cheap:

```shell
$ examples/conversation.sh \
    -s "you are an agentic coder." \
    -u 'localhost:11434#m=qwen3.8' \
    -mf examples/agent-mcp/mcp.json

  Using: /tmp/tmp.AZHfLtoGbZ

  >> let's make towers of hanoi in perl
  ...
```

And there's a coding agent... really ...

## MCP

### MCPFile
This file is what you usually need to make for an mcp server definition:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "<some_server>": {
      "command": "<some_command>",
      "args": ["<some>", "<args>"]
    }
    ...
  }
}
```

There's a basic extension on MCP here. You can explicity disable an MCP server by adding a flag `"disabled": true` like so:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "<some_server>": {
      "command": "<some_command>",
      "disabled": true,
      "args": ["<some>", "<args>"]
    }
    ...
  }
}
```

You can also set this in a tool function definition, for instance:

```json
  {
    "type": "function",
    "disabled" true,    << right here!
    "function": {
      "name": "list_mp3s",
      "description": "List all MP3 files in the music library",
      "parameters": {
        ...
      }
    }
  },
```


### MCPCat
MCP can be simple with simple tools. There's one included here. `mcpcat` is a 22 line Bash script. 

Here is an example of it in use:

```shell
$ mcpcat init list | \
  uv run python -m my-server | \
  jq .
```

Let's say there's a calculator mcp, you can do something like

```shell
$ mcpcat init call calculate '{"expression":"2+2"}' | \
   uv run python -m mcp_server_calculator \
   jq .
```

The beauty here is you can see the Emperor's new clothes up close. Simply omit the pipe.

```shell
$ mcpcat init call calculate '{"expression":"2+2"}'
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":4,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2024-11-05","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"mcpcat","version":"1.0"}}}
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"notifications/initialized"}
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":3,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"calculate","arguments":{"expression":"2+2"}}}
```

That's all the STDIO Transport is. 

There's ways of doing the network transports with this script as well. All you need is the appropriate network tools and compose away.
